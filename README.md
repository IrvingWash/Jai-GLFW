# Jai-GLFW

Hand-crafted GLFW bindings for Jai.

## Approach
- Snake case
- No `GLFW` prefixes
- Native enums whenever appropriate

## Usage
Put the contents of this repo either in your `jai/modules` or in a `modules` directory in your project dir. There are other ways, but if you need them, you should already know how to achieve that.
